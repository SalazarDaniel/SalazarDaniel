Hi there ðŸ‘‹.
I'm currently studying software engineering at Universidad Modelo in Mexico.
I'm learning algorithms, data structures, general development.
I personally want to learn cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
I'm looking to collaborate on the topics I personally want to learn.
